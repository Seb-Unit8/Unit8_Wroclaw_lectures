The below resources are not meant to be an exhaustive list to be consumed, but rather more in depth treatments of areas you may wish to brush up on.

## Learning Resources
### General
* [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/#contents) and the associated [repo](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) for running/editing the notebooks locally
* [Bayesian vs Frequentist reasoning in plain language](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/22/bayesian-and-frequentist-reasoning-in-plain-english)
